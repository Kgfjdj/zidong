# Use it to make profits: [#1](https://github.com/StageGuard/SkyAutoPlayerScript/issues/1)

# Embezzle shared sheets: 

Gitee user [嗨游圈(@vipssp)](https://gitee.com/vipssp) upload all shared sheets in [/shared_sheets](https://github.com/StageGuard/SkyAutoPlayerScript/tree/master/shared_sheets) **without permission** to his [Gitee repository](https://gitee.com/vipssp/SkyAutoPlayerScript/)

He also doesn't delete these sheets from his repository after [notification](https://gitee.com/vipssp/SkyAutoPlayerScript/commit/197925a71ff9cc6248be682a55406fc5814b12d7#note_3637784).

I decide to pin him in README.md after communicating with some sheet sharer.

### ⚠️WARNING
CodeFactor Evaluation: [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/stageguard/skyautoplayerscript/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/stageguard/skyautoplayerscript)

This program is a single-file project which means all modules are in a single file. Also, my coding skill is poor, so it is `a little hard` to understand source code.
